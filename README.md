### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer) and npm installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage different Node versions.

### Installation & Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Reformer01/crypto-trade-template-9143.git
    cd crypto-trade-template-9143
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install all the necessary packages for the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This will start the Vite development server with hot-reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action!

## üöÄ Deployment

This is a standard Vite and React application, which makes deployment straightforward. You can host it on any platform that supports static sites.

Here are a few popular options:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

To prepare your application for deployment, run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with all your production-ready static files. You can then upload the contents of this directory to your hosting provider of choice.
